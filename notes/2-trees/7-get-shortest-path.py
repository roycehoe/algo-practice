"""
Given an undirected graph, find the shortest path from a given source to a given destination. Return the length of this path.

Note: The best strategy would be to use a breath first search. This is because it approaches the question more logically. You would always want to check the first siblings, second sibling and so on. This is opposed to searching as deep as possible.
